# My Jekyll Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I host my projects using Jekyll themes.

## About

This repository serves as a platform for hosting my projects using various Jekyll themes. Jekyll is a static site generator that allows easy website creation and hosting directly from GitHub repositories.

## Hosting a Page

In this repository, I've utilized Jekyll themes to create and host my projects. By simply committing your project files to the repository, GitHub Pages automatically builds and serves your site using the chosen Jekyll theme.

### How to Host a Page

1. **Choose a Jekyll Theme**: Select a Jekyll theme that fits your project's requirements.
   
2. **Commit Your Project Files**: Upload your project files, including markdown files, images, and any other necessary assets, to your GitHub repository.

3. **Configure `_config.yml` (Optional)**: Customize the `_config.yml` file if you want to modify site settings like title, description, or navigation links.

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository's settings on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, selecting the branch where your project files are stored.

5. **Access Your Site**: Once GitHub Pages builds your site, it will be accessible at `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository`.

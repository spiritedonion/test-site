# PROCEDURE

**1. ****Physical Setup:**

1. Connect the power adapter and turn on the device.

2. Connect a computer to one of FortiGate's Ethernet ports for initial configuration.

**2. ****Network Configuration:**

Configure the FortiGate's network interfaces based on your network topology and requirements. Set IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateway information.

**Step 1: Accessing the FortiGate Web Interface**

1. Connect a computer to the FortiGate using an Ethernet cable.

2. Open a web browser and enter the default IP address of the FortiGate (usually 192.168.1.99) in the address bar.

3. Log in with the administrator credentials. (username = admin & password = “blank”)

**Step 2: Interface Configuration**

1. Go to "Network" to "Interfaces."

2. Configure the interfaces based on your network topology:

3. Internal interfaces (LAN): Assign IP addresses and subnet masks to LAN interfaces connecting to internal networks.

4. External interfaces (WAN): Configure the WAN interface that connects to the internet or external network.

5. DMZ interfaces: If applicable, configure any demilitarized zone (DMZ) interfaces.

**Step 3: IP Address Configuration**

1. For the WAN interface, set the IP address provided by your ISP or configure it as per your network requirements. Choose between DHCP or static IP address based on your ISP's settings.

2. For LAN interfaces, assign IP addresses and subnet masks to match your internal network addressing scheme.

**Step 4: Default Gateway Configuration**

1. Configure the default gateway on the FortiGate to point to the next-hop gateway provided by your ISP for the WAN interface.

2. For LAN interfaces, the default gateway is usually FortiGate's own IP address on the corresponding interface.

**Step 5: DNS Configuration**

1. Set up DNS servers to resolve domain names. Go to "Network" to "DNS" and enter the IP addresses of your preferred DNS servers.

**Step 6: Static Routes (if needed)**

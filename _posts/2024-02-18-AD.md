## 1. Executive Summary

The objective of the penetration test was to thoroughly assess the security of the Windows Server 2016 environment and Active Directory configuration, aiming to identify potential vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers. Various attack scenarios, including brute force attacks, password spraying attacks, ASREPRoast attacks, SQL injection attacks, and command injection attacks, were simulated to uncover critical weaknesses in the system.

Upon examination of the Windows Server 2016 setup, default configurations and delayed application of crucial security patches were discovered, leaving the system vulnerable to known exploits. Additionally, weaknesses in the Active Directory configuration were noted, such as weak password policies, inadequate access controls, and insufficient segregation of duties, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

The findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive remediation measures to strengthen the organization's security posture. Recommendations include prioritizing regular patching and updates, enforcing robust password policies, reviewing and reinforcing least privilege access controls, implementing effective network segmentation, and conducting frequent security awareness training for employees.

Implementing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization's security posture, reducing the likelihood of cyber threats and protecting its assets, reputation, and stakeholder confidence.

## 2. Introduction

The goal of this penetration test was to evaluate Windows Server 2016 security in detail using an Active Directory environment that mimics a standard business infrastructure. Finding weaknesses and possible attack routes was the main goal in order to offer detailed suggestions for strengthening the security posture as a whole.

In the digital and linked world of today, businesses mostly depend on technological infrastructure to run their operations effectively. For enterprises looking to create a reliable and scalable network infrastructure, Windows Server 2016 together with Active Directory is a popular option. To reduce possible risks, enterprises must constantly assess and improve the infrastructure's security due to the growing sophistication of cyberattacks.

Our objectives in doing this penetration test were to mimic actual attack scenarios and evaluate how resilient the Windows Server 2016 setup and Active Directory configuration were to different online threats. We sought to find flaws and vulnerabilities that may be used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, tamper with data integrity, or interfere with company operations using a combination of automated and human methods.

The firm will be able to improve its overall security posture by prioritizing repair activities, implementing efficient security controls, and making well-informed decisions about security investments thanks to the data gathered from this penetration test. The company may strengthen its defenses against cyberattacks and preserve the confidence of its stakeholders, assets, and reputation by promptly resolving vulnerabilities that are found and putting the suggested security measures into place.

In order to help the company mitigate risks and strengthen its security posture, we will offer comprehensive findings, analysis, and suggestions based on our evaluation throughout this report.

## 5.3 Attacks

### 5.3.1 Brute Force Attack

- To execute this attack, the CrackMapExec tool was utilized. CrackMapExec is a powerful penetration testing tool commonly used for scanning and exploitation tasks in Windows environments. It supports various protocols, including SMB, and allows for automated password guessing using wordlists.

**Command: `sudo crackmapexec smb 192.168.85.3 -u ap -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`**

- In this specific command:
    - `sudo crackmapexec smb 192.168.85.3`: Specifies the use of CrackMapExec to target the SMB protocol on the IP address 192.168.85.3. The SMB protocol is commonly used for file sharing in Windows environments.
    - `u ap`: Specifies the username "ap" for authentication. This is the username that will be used in the brute force attack.
    - `p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`: Specifies the path to a wordlist file containing a list of commonly used passwords (rockyou.txt). CrackMapExec will attempt to authenticate with each password in the wordlist in order to gain access to the system.

![](assets/ad/Untitled11.png)

The provided image depicts the output of the brute force attack conducted using CrackMapExec. It provides insight into the results of the attack, including any successful authentication attempts and the discovered credentials.

---

### 5.3.2 Password Spraying Attack

- This attack was carried out using the CrackMapExec program. A potent penetration testing tool called CrackMapExec is frequently used for Windows environment scanning and exploitation activities. It enables automated password guessing using wordlists and supports a number of protocols, including SMB.
    
    **Command:** `crackmapexec smb 192.168.85.3 -d [server.web](http://server.web/) -u username.txt -p Password@123 --continue-on-success`
    
    - In this specific command:
        - `crackmapexec smb 192.168.85.3`: Initiates CrackMapExec to target the SMB protocol on the specified IP address.
        - `d server.web`: Specifies the domain name for authentication.
        - `u username.txt`: Provides a file containing usernames for the attack.
        - `p Password@123`: Sets the password to be used during the attack.
        - `-continue-on-success`: Instructs the tool to continue the attack even after successful authentication attempts.

![](assets/ad/Untitled12.png)

The provided screenshot below illustrates the output of the password spraying attack using CrackMapExec, revealing insights into successful authentication attempts and discovered credentials.

Instead of trying multiple passwords for a single username, try a single password across multiple usernames. This reduces the risk of account lockouts and increases the likelihood of success. 

---

### 5.3.3 Asreproast attack

- The ASREPRoast attack utilizes tools such as **`GetNPUsers.py`** from the Impacket toolkit to request AS_REP messages containing encrypted ticket-granting service (TGS) tickets for vulnerable Active Directory user accounts. These messages are then captured and cracked offline using password-cracking tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat, revealing plaintext passwords. This attack leverages weaknesses in authentication mechanisms to compromise user accounts within the domain, demonstrating a significant security risk in Active Directory environments.
    
    **Command:** `python3 GetNPUser.py [server.web/](http://server.web/) -userfile ../../username.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.asreproast`
    
    - In this specific command:
        - **`python3 GetNPUser.py`**: Executes the Python script **`GetNPUser.py`** for performing the attack.
        - **`server.web/`**: Specifies the target Active Directory domain for the attack.
        - **`userfile ../../username.txt`**: Specifies the path to a file containing a list of usernames to target within the domain.
        - **`format hashcat`**: Specifies the output format for the captured hashes, compatible with Hashcat for offline cracking.
        - **`outputfile hashes.asreproast`**: Specifies the output file name for storing the captured hashes in the ASREPRoast attack format.

![](assets/ad/Untitled13.png)

The ASREPRoast attack was successfully executed against the domain **`server.web`**. The Impacket toolkit was used with the **`GetNPUser.py`** script to retrieve AS-REP hashes for users within the domain.

*Cracking the Hashes*

**Command: `john -w=password_kerb.txt hashs.txt`**

- In this specific command:
    - **`john`**: Refers to the John the Ripper password cracking tool.
    - **`w=password_kerb.txt`**: Specifies the wordlist file (**`password_kerb.txt`**) containing potential passwords.
    - **`hashs.txt`**: Represents the file containing hashed passwords obtained from the ASREPRoast attack.
    - The command aims to crack the hashes in **`hashs.txt`** using the passwords from **`password_kerb.txt`**.

![](assets/ad/Untitled14.png)
The ASREPRoast attack proved effective against the `server.web` domain. By employing the Impacket toolkit and the `GetNPUser.py` script, AS-REP hashes for domain users were obtained. Following this, `John the Ripper` was employed to crack these hashes offline, with the intention of uncovering plaintext passwords linked to the hashed credentials.
